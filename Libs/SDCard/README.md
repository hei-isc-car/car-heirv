# SD Card Reader

This library contains code to interface with an SD cards using SD 4 bits mode.

The base modules come from [https://github.com/WangXuan95/FPGA-SDcard-Reader/tree/main](https://github.com/WangXuan95/FPGA-SDcard-Reader/tree/main).

They have been modified to support the 4 bits mode.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ The modules have NOT been thoroughly tested. They should not be used in production before a proper review. ⚠️⚠️⚠️
